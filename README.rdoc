= Ruby FFMpeg Library

A simple bridge around the FFMPeg library, concentrting in particular 
in libavcodec/libavformat for now.

To install run 

 ruby extconf.rb

You may need to add +--with+ on mac, to point it to macports' /opt/local for the libraries.

This has worked on my snow leopard machine:

  sudo ports install ffmpeg
  (go have coffee)
  $ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" ruby extconf.rb --with-avformat-dir=/opt/local
  make
